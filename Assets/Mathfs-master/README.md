# Mathfs
Freya's expanded math functionality for Unity!
- This is primarily a way for me to share the math functionality I write and use in my own personal projects
- I will recklessly edit and adapt things without too much thought into backwards compatibility
- Minimum Unity version is currently 2021.2 due to using newer C# version features. It may be possible to auto-downgrade through your IDE if necessary
- Commits with version tags should be relatively stable. Other commits may not be

## Installation instructions

There are several ways to install this library into your project:

- **Plain install**
   - Clone or [download](https://github.com/FreyaHolmer/Mathfs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) this repository and put it somewhere in the Assets folder of your Unity project
- **Unity Package Manager (UPM)**:
   - Add either of the the following lines to *Packages/manifest.json*:
   - `"com.acegikmo.mathfs": "https://github.com/FreyaHolmer/Mathfs.git#0.1.0",` if you want to target a specific version (recommended)
   - `"com.acegikmo.mathfs": "https://github.com/FreyaHolmer/Mathfs.git",` if you want to pull the latest commit (potentially unstable)
   - More information about UPM and git [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html)
- **[OpenUPM](https://openupm.com)**
   - After installing [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli), run the following command:
   - `openupm add com.acegikmo.mathfs`

After installation you will be able to access the library in scripts by including the namespace `using Freya`

## Changes
Mathfs.cs **does not fully match Unity's Mathf.cs**, I've made a few changes:
 - All angles are in radians, no methods use degrees
 - Lerp and InverseLerp:
   - Unclamped by default
   - LerpClamped/InverseLerpClamped are now the special case functions/exceptions
   - Uses the more numerically stable evaluation
 - Smoothstep is removed in favor of the more explicit:
   - LerpSmooth (which is how it was implemented) and
   - InverseLerpSmooth (which is how it is implemented everywhere but Unity's Mathf.cs)
 - Min/Max functions with arbitrary inputs/array input will throw on empty instead of returning 0
